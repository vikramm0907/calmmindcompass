            <h1>Extending a Helping Hand
</h1>
            
        </div>
        <div class="intro">
            <p>Welcome to the heart of Calm Mind Compass – the "Extending a Helping Hand" section. We
recognize that life's journey can be both beautiful and challenging, and during difficult times,
finding a supportive community is essential. Here, we offer an empathetic space for individuals
who are currently experiencing emotional distress and seeking help.
At Calm Mind Compass, we believe that every person deserves to be heard, understood, and
supported. Our mission is to provide you with the guidance, resources, and compassionate
companionship to navigate through life's ups and downs with resilience and hope.
What are mental health problems?
People from all walks of life have experienced stress at one point of time in their lives – from
employees who are overwhelmed with work, young students going to school, family members
due to financial needs, those impacted by the loss of loved ones, or the people who faced
difficulties in accessing mental health services due to lack of awareness.
Experiencing a mental health problem is often upsetting, confusing and frightening – particularly
at first. If you become unwell, you may feel that it's a sign of weakness, or that you are 'losing
your mind'. You just want to move away from everything because you feel like you are the sole
cause of all your problems and are a burden to everyone else.
These fears are often reinforced by the negative (and often unrealistic) way that people
experiencing mental health problems are shown on TV, in films and by the media. This may stop
you from talking about your problems, or seeking help. This, in turn, is likely to increase your
distress and sense of isolation.
However, in reality, mental health problems are a common human experience.
Mental health problems affect around one in four people in any given year. They range from
common problems, such as depression and anxiety, to rarer problems such as schizophrenia
and others.
Some mental health problems cause us more serious distress and problems with our lives, and
may continue for years. For instance, hearing and seeing things that others can’t see, or
believing that other people are out to get us, can cause conflicts with other people. As a result,
we may lose jobs, friends, children, housing and even our liberty and lives.
We use the phrase 'mental health problems', as many people have told us this feels helpful for
them. But you might be more familiar with terms such as 'poor emotional health', 'overloaded',
'burnt out' or 'overwhelmed'. Or you may feel that terms such as 'mental illness' or 'mental health
issues' describe your experiences better, or are easier to explain to other people in your life.
Symptoms of Depression:
Persistent feelings of sadness or emptiness
Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed
Significant changes in appetite and weight
Insomnia or excessive sleeping
Fatigue or loss of energy
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt
Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide</p>
