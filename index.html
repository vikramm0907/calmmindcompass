            <p>Mental well-being encompasses psychological, emotional, and social health. It refers to how we
move through life and react to its turbulence. These fluctuations can range from everyday
stressors to significant life shifts.
Our mental well-being informs the details of our life. This includes how we make friends and
socialise, how we manage stress, and the choices we make in response to everyday situations
of life.
Mental well-being is concerned with those not suffering from mental illness. It focuses on those
who could get better at being the best version of themselves and live a more meaningful life.
Mental well-being is not merely the absence of mental illness; rather, it is a state of emotional
and psychological strength.
Psychological health encompasses self-esteem, self-acceptance, and a positive outlook on life.
It is about understanding ourselves, our strengths, weaknesses, and growth areas, and working
towards personal development and self-improvement.
